There are _n_ friends standing in a line, each numbured from _1_ through _n_ inclusive. The first one, friend _1_, holds a buton. Each second, the buton is passed to the next friend in line. Once it reaches the end of the line, the direction of passing is reversed and passing continues.

**Example** 
- _friends = 4_
- _tine = 5_

Friends are numbered _1_ through _4_. Friend 1 holds the buton at time _0_. At time _1_. It is passed to friend 2. Over 5 seconds, the buton is passed as 1->2->3->4->3->2. The friend passing the baton at time 5 is friend _3_. The friend receiving the buton is friend _2_.
